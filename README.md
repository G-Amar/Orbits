# Solar Systems
An implementation of a Solar System in various programming languages

Each of the celestial bodies is connected to the object they are orbiting by distance. This is represented by a weighted graph.

Distances between celestial bodies can be calculated an returned easily.

This project was done in Elixir, Haskell, Rust, and Smalltalk programming languages.
